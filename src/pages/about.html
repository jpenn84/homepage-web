                    This site is a showcase of my programming journey.
                    Its original purpose was to reserve a Java package namespace.
                    But now, it's a place for me to experiment with web development and share my projects.

                    I began my career in QA shortly after graduating from tech school.
                    After some time and experience, I became a QA lead, where I got to use my coding skills to architect
                    a QA automation solution.
                    I became a QA engineer and finally got to use my coding skills at work.
                    Now I want to practice and showcase my abilities as a software engineer.
